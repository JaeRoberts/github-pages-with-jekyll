# Welcome to my blog

I'm very excited to take part in the Frontend Foxes co-op course and hope to learn a lot more in the next 11 months. It's all very exciting, and I'll have a chance to learn in a more virtual classroom setting instead of in my own silo. I hoep to become more familiar and understanding of JavaScript as well.

One step at a time.

Here we go!
